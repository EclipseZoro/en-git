# ðŸŽ‰ Extension UPDATE - Inline Stats Feature Added!

## What's New?

Your Chrome extension now shows **GitHub profile stats directly in the popup**! No more just redirecting to the full app.

### âœ¨ New Features:

1. **Auto-Detection**: When you open the extension on a GitHub profile page, it automatically loads that user's stats
2. **Quick Stats Display**:
   - Avatar & Bio
   - Total Repositories
   - Total Stars (across all repos)
   - Followers count
   - Total Forks
   - Top 5 programming languages
   - Most starred repository
3. **Manual Search**: Enter any username to load their stats instantly
4. **Recent History**: Click recent usernames to quickly reload their stats
5. **Deep Dive Button**: Opens full analysis in the main app

### ðŸ“Š What You'll See:

**On GitHub Profile Pages:**

- Extension automatically detects username (e.g., `github.com/torvalds`)
